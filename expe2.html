    '<p><strong>What is the purpose of the study?</strong></p>' +
    "<p>This study investigates how people understand certain linguistic expressions in English and Chinese, aiming to contribute to a better understanding of language and communication across cultures.</p>" +
    '<p>&nbsp;</p>' +
    '<p><strong>Why have I been chosen to take part?</strong></p>' +
    "<p>You have been invited to participate because the study focuses on understanding how native speakers of English and Chinese interpret linguistic expressions. We are seeking individuals who meet this criterion to ensure the study's findings are accurate and meaningful. Approximately 100 participants will take part in this research.</p>"+
    '<p>&nbsp;</p>' +
    '<p><strong>Do I have to take part?</strong></p>' +
    "<p>Participation is voluntary and participants are free to withdraw at any time without explanation and without incurring a disadvantage.</p>"+
    '<p>&nbsp;</p>' +
    '<p><strong>What will happen if I take part?</strong></p>' +
    "<p>If you decide to take part in this study, you will complete a series of online tasks. These tasks involve reading sentences or phrases and answering simple questions about their meaning.</p>"+
    '<p>&nbsp;</p>' +
    "<p>The study will take approximately 10 minutes to complete.Your main responsibility as a participant is to follow the instructions provided on the screen and answer the questions as accurately as possible.</p>"+
